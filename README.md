### Personal Profile

I am a Full Stack Developer thanks to an intense course provided by Makers Academy. As a recent graduate, I learnt and worked on new technologies with no prior experience, which at times was challenging. Despite this, I was also able to apply my skills from my previous career to tech, such as communication, problem solving and teamwork. In just two weeks, along with my team, I built GrowUp an incredible and interactive tasks manager ios app in React Native and you can see my [final project presentation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YatQ7l54Xjc).  
For the last few months Iâ€™ve been taking on a personal project, an highly responsive fantastic [arcade game](https://matteo-games.web.app) (web based) that I developed in javascript. It has been great to learn more about front end technologies and deploying with Firebase. Although Iâ€™m a teamplayer, this solo project was a great experience to overcome challenges when you have no one around to ask. I am currently seeking Junior positions which will allow me to further improve my technical skills with high quality standards.
