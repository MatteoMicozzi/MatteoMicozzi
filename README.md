### About Me

While most recently I’ve been crafting unique cocktails as a mixologist and supervisor, my career has taken me full-circle back to technology. I grew up in a family-owned arcade and began coding microprocessors at school, making my first website in 2006 and later progressing to an engineering role programming alarm systems. As an enthusiastic learner , the pandemic presented an opportunity for me to return to my first and continuing passion and I attended the coding bootcamp, Makers.

- 🔭 I’m currently open to new opportunities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Node.js and Firebase.
- 🤓 I will soon start a new project “The game of life” by John Conway with a graphic interaction.
- 🎥 I saw a few docu movies, the first about AI [AlphaGo](https://youtu.be/WXuK6gekU1Y) and the second [The Art of Code](https://youtu.be/6avJHaC3C2U).
- 🍝🍕🍺🍷🍸 lover.
