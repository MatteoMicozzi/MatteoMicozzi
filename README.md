### About Me

While most recently I’ve been crafting unique cocktails as a mixologist and supervisor, my career has taken me full-circle back to technology. I grew up in a family-owned arcade and began coding microprocessors at school, making my first website in 2006 and later progressing to an engineering role programming alarm systems. As an enthusiastic learner , the pandemic presented an opportunity for me to return to my first and continuing passion and I attended the coding bootcamp, Makers.
